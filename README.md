# Unicorn Investor Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes unicorn companies worldwide to determine top investors and the geographical distribution of funding. Using Power BI, I explored the trends, top investors, and which cities/countries are attracting the most unicorn investments.

## Analysis Process
1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Cleaned the `Valuation` column to remove non-numeric characters.
   - Split the `Investors` column where multiple investors were listed.

2. **Calculations**:
   - Used DAX formulas to calculate cumulative unicorn count, total investor funding by country, and more.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Created visuals using Power BI to analyze trends, top investors, and distribution of funding across countries/cities.

## Key Insights
- The number of unicorn companies has grown significantly since 2015, with a peak in 2021.
- **Sequoia Capital** and **SoftBank** are among the top investors, investing across multiple industries and regions.
- The **United States**, **China**, and **India** attract the most funding, with cities like **San Francisco**, **Beijing**, and **Bangalore** emerging as major unicorn hubs.
